# Get a Slack message when your GitHub repo is forked

[Deploy this bot on your GitHub repo via flows.network](#deploy-your-own-Github-fork-Messenger-bot), and you will get a Slack bot that sends a message every time your GitHub repo is forked by a user. It helps DevRel and maintainers to get the latest updates of the Open source project.

This is a simple example of how flows.network works: When someone forked the designated GitHub repo, you will receive a Slack message.

## Deploy your own GitHub fork Messenger bot

1. Load [Get a Slack notification when your GitHub repo is forked](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/github-fork-alert-slack) template.
2. Configure and authorize your Slack access
3. Configure the bot to follow the fork growth of a specified GitHub repo

### 0 Prerequisites

You will need to sign into [flows.network](https://flows.network/) from your GitHub account. It is free.

### 1 Load the template for monitoring the fork status

[**Just click here**](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/github-fork-alert-slack)

Click on the **Create and Build** button.

### 2 Configure the bot to access your Slack

Next, you will tell the bot which Slack channel you want your alert messages to be sent to.

* `slack_channel`:
enter the name of your Slack organization where you want to deploy the bot. Case sensitive.

* `slack_workspace`:
enter the name of the Slack channel where you want to deploy the bot. Case sensitive.

Enter your Slack workspace and channel respectively in the red boxes below.

Next, let's grant flows.network to access the Slack channel you just entered. The Slack channel must be public.

Click the "Connect/+ Add new authentication" button to authenticate your Slack account. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to install the `flows-network` bot on your workspace. This workspace is the one you entered into the `slack_workspace` above.

> If you have authenticated the Slack access before, you can see the purple Connect button turns gray Connected button. Just ignore this step and continue the next steps.

### 3 Configure the bot to access GitHub

Next, you will tell the bot which GitHub repo's fork growth it needs to monitor.

* `github_owner`: enter the name of the GitHub org for the repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.
* `github_repo` : enter the name of GitHub repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.

Click on the **Connect** or **+ Add new authentication** button to give the function access to the GitHub repo to deploy the ðŸ¤–. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to the repo.

> If you have authenticated the GitHub access before, you can see the purple Connect button turns gray Connected button. Just ignore this step and click the Check button.

### 4. Click the Deploy button to deploy your function.

After that, click the Check button to see your flow details. As soon as the flow function's status becomes `ready` and the flow's status became `running`, you will get a Slack message every time the repo is forked!
